# Integrating Strangler safely

Strangler routes requests; your application owns access rules, the API contract and
the deployment procedure. Complete these steps for each feature before enabling it.

## Access checks and Yii hooks

Put authentication, HTTP verb checks, CSRF validation for session-authenticated
writes, input validation and resource permissions **before Strangler**, in filters
that complete their checks before calling `$filterChain->run()`.
Use your actual application's filters; names in the README are examples.

Forwarding skips the legacy action, `beforeAction()` and `afterAction()`, including
inherited controller implementations. Ending the proxied response also prevents
previous filters from returning to `postFilter()`. Audit transaction cleanup and
logging in those hooks. If cleanup is necessary, use a tested request-end mechanism
such as Yii's `onEndRequest`; it is not a place to defer an access decision.

Strangler does not infer resource permissions from `X-User-Id`. Decide which checks
remain in Yii and which business invariants the new backend must enforce. A public
Yii action may forward a guest request; its user identifier is an empty string.

## Write-action validation

For the catalog contract, the incoming update is POST even though its outgoing
route uses PUT. A preceding filter can enforce this and reject conflicting IDs:

```php
public function filterValidateCatalog(CFilterChain $chain): void
{
    $action = strtolower($chain->action->getId());
    $expected = ['get' => 'GET', 'create' => 'POST', 'update' => 'POST'];
    $request = Yii::app()->request;
    if (isset($expected[$action]) && $request->getRequestType() !== $expected[$action]) {
        throw new CHttpException(405, 'Method not allowed.');
    }

    if ($action === 'update') {
        // Use the same validated input as payloadUsing() if you accept form fields.
        $body = $request->getRawBody();
        try {
            $payload = json_decode($body, true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR | JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING);
        } catch (JsonException) {
            throw new CHttpException(400, 'Invalid JSON.');
        }
        if (!is_array($payload)) {
            throw new CHttpException(400, 'Expected a JSON object.');
        }
        $requestId = $request->getParam('id');
        $bodyId = $payload['ID'] ?? null;
        if (($requestId !== null && !is_scalar($requestId))
            || ($bodyId !== null && !is_scalar($bodyId))) {
            throw new CHttpException(400, 'Invalid identifier.');
        }
        if ($requestId !== null && $bodyId !== null && (string) $requestId !== (string) $bodyId) {
            throw new CHttpException(400, 'Conflicting identifiers.');
        }
        // Validate required fields and access to this same ID in your application.
    }
    $chain->run();
}
```

Place `validateCatalog` before your resource-access filter and Strangler. Keep
session-authenticated write CSRF checks there too: use your application's existing
validated token/header contract. Enabling a Strangler route does not add those
checks. Errors thrown by these filters use the host's API error handler.

For cleanup that must run for both executors, register a request-end callback during
application bootstrap, rather than relying on `afterAction()` or `postFilter()`:

```php
Yii::app()->attachEventHandler('onEndRequest', static function (CEvent $event): void {
    // Release application-owned request resources; keep this safe to call once.
});
```

Use a real HTTP request to verify that your cleanup runs on a proxied response,
legacy response and denied request. Do not keep uncommitted transactions open
across a backend call; an end hook is not distributed transaction coordination.

## API errors from Yii

For API controllers, configure an application-owned error action so adapter bugs and
invalid backend responses keep the legacy JSON error contract. In Yii configuration:

```php
'components' => [
    'errorHandler' => ['errorAction' => 'apiError/error'],
],
```

Create `ApiErrorController` in your application's controller directory:

```php
class ApiErrorController extends CController
{
    public function actionError(): void
    {
        $error = Yii::app()->errorHandler->error;
        $status = $error['code'] ?? 500;
        header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8', true, $status);
        echo json_encode([
            'success' => false,
            'error' => [
                'code' => $status >= 500 ? 'internal_error' : 'request_rejected',
                'fields' => [],
            ],
        ], JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
    }
}
```

Use this route for your API requests; preserve an appropriate HTML error action for
browser pages if the application serves both. The error action must be reachable
without repeating the failing filters. Run production with `YII_DEBUG=false`, because
Yii debug exception rendering bypasses its configured error action. Keep exception
details in server logs. Test malformed backend JSON and a throwing adapter: both
must return `500` JSON without a second backend or legacy execution.

## Trusted channel

The backend must accept identity headers only from your Yii application. A private
network or authenticated gateway can provide this trust. If you choose a shared
service token, configure it on the server, never from the incoming client's header.
Use HTTPS and a secret supplied through your deployment's environment on both sides.

In Yii's configuration bootstrap:

```php
$token = getenv('STRANGLER_TOKEN');
if (!is_string($token) || $token === '') {
    throw new RuntimeException('STRANGLER_TOKEN must be configured.');
}

$catalogEnabled = filter_var(
    getenv('STRANGLER_CATALOG_ENABLED') ?: 'false',
    FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN,
    FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE,
) ?? false;

// Add this under Yii's params.
$strangler = [
    'base_uri' => 'https://backend.example',
    'headers' => ['X-Strangler-Token' => $token],
    'forward_headers' => ['Accept-Language', 'X-Request-Id', 'Idempotency-Key'],
    'features' => ['catalog' => $catalogEnabled],
    'timeout' => 10,
    'connect_timeout' => 3,
];
```

Assign `$strangler` to `params.strangler`. Only boolean `true` enables a feature;
strings such as `'false'` do not. Parse environment values explicitly as above.

At the new backend's entry point, before routing or using `X-User-Id`:

```php
$expected = getenv('STRANGLER_TOKEN');
$provided = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_STRANGLER_TOKEN'] ?? '';

if (!is_string($expected) || $expected === '') {
    http_response_code(503);
    exit;
}

if (!is_string($provided) || $provided === '' || !hash_equals($expected, $provided)) {
    http_response_code(403);
    exit;
}

$userId = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_USER_ID'] ?? ''; // Empty for a permitted guest request.
```

Verify that a direct call without the token fails and a permitted Yii request works.
A client's `X-Strangler-Token` is discarded; only the server configuration supplies
it. The diagnostic `X-Strangler: 1` must never authorize a request. Rotate the token
through your deployment process; keep it out of repositories and request logs.

## Configuration reference

All settings below belong to `params.strangler`; feature names match
`Strangler::proxy('catalog')`. Keep environment parsing in your application's
configuration bootstrap.

| Setting | Default | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base_uri` | Missing: handled request returns `500` | One HTTP(S) origin, e.g. `https://backend.example:8443`. No credentials, path prefix, query or fragment. Put `/v2` in route paths. |
| `features` | `[]` | Map of feature names to boolean flags; only `true` forwards. |
| `headers` | `[]` | Server-owned string headers, including the trusted token. Override forwarded client values; no invalid names or newlines. |
| `forward_headers` | `['Accept-Language', 'X-Request-Id', 'Idempotency-Key']` | Explicit client-header allowlist. Reserved identity/token and transport headers remain blocked. |
| `timeout` | `10` | Positive finite seconds for the full request. Invalid values use the default. |
| `connect_timeout` | `3` | Positive finite seconds for connecting. Invalid values use the default. |
| `verify_ssl` | `true` | Boolean or absolute CA-bundle path. Use `false` only deliberately for local development. |
| `log_requests` | `false` | Enable forwarding logs; `YII_DEBUG` also enables them. |

Routes must start with one `/` and cannot change the origin. Redirects are always
returned to the client; there is no redirect-following option. The filter never
retries a backend request.

The controller builder configures behavior for one feature:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get/post/put/patch/delete/head($action, $path)` | Map one Yii action to an outgoing method/path. Each action may appear once. |
| `usingAdapter($adapter)` | Supply a `StranglerAdapterInterface` instance, autoloadable class name, or Yii `['class' => ..., ...]` configuration. |
| `payloadUsing($reader)` | Read a validated legacy body as an array, once per handled request. |
| `bodyIdentifier($field)` | Set the original-body fallback field for `{id}`; disabled by default. Request `id` takes precedence. |
| `bypassUsing($callback)` | Decide before reading/forwarding payload, from controller, lowercase action and original query. `true` keeps Yii. |
| `bypassWhenPayloadHas($action, $fields)` | Keep Yii if any named original-payload field is present, including `null`. |
| `afterAttempt($callback)` | Observe outgoing method/path after a transport attempt, before response adaptation. |
| `build()` | Return the native Yii filter configuration. |

## Headers, TLS and payloads

By default, only `Accept-Language`, `X-Request-Id` and `Idempotency-Key` are forwarded
from clients. Set `forward_headers` to the complete allowlist your API requires,
including those defaults if you still need them. `headers` contains server-owned values, which override forwarded values.
Client identity, marker, locale and token headers are never forwarded, even if listed;
transport-specific headers are excluded too.

Cookie and Authorization are excluded by default. An explicit `forward_headers`
entry can opt in only when your backend contract requires those client credentials;
this is a deliberate change from the normal Yii-owned session model. Server-owned
backend credentials belong in `headers`. Backend `Set-Cookie` is always removed.
The JSON request has its own Content-Type. If an adapter rewrites a response body,
set its Content-Type and remove obsolete ETag, compression and cache metadata; the
[catalog example](api-adaptation.md) shows an explicit response-header policy.

Certificate verification defaults to `true`. For an internal certificate authority,
set `verify_ssl` to an absolute CA-bundle path. Disable it only deliberately in a
local development environment. Positive finite `timeout` and `connect_timeout`
values are in seconds; invalid values, including zero, use the defaults of 10 and 3.

The default payload reader accepts a JSON object or array. An empty body means no
payload; malformed JSON, `null` and scalar JSON return `400` before forwarding.
This validation applies to every mapped action, including GET and HEAD: their bodies
can supply route or bypass fields but are not sent upstream. Do not send irrelevant
bodies on read requests. Without an adapter or custom reader, write JSON bytes are
preserved. Adapters receive PHP arrays with large integers represented as strings;
they own the re-encoded object's shape, including empty objects.
`payloadUsing()` reads form fields explicitly and must return an array; validate its
structure in the preceding filters. The filter uses one payload snapshot for the
bypass decision and forwarding. File uploads and arbitrary raw bodies are outside
this JSON adapter's scope.

## Rollout and rollback

1. Keep the feature disabled while adapting and testing the old client's contract.
2. Verify the outgoing URL, method, body and query; then test successful responses,
   validation errors, denied access, malformed input and backend timeouts.
3. Agree who writes each dataset and what Yii will see if the feature is disabled.
   A flag changes routing; it does not migrate data back or restore an old schema.
4. Define how deployment or support staff change the flag and reload configuration.
   PHP workers may reload config per request; cached config or long-running workers
   need your application's explicit reload procedure. Check the next request.
5. Enable one adapted action, observe it, and expand only after compatibility holds.

Turning off a feature affects subsequent requests after configuration is reloaded.
In-flight requests continue with the executor already chosen. If new data is no
longer compatible with Yii, rollback requires a data plan, not just a flag change.

Requests are never automatically retried or replayed in Yii. Forwarded
`Idempotency-Key` works only if the backend defines and enforces that contract;
the package does not deduplicate operations by itself.

For repeatable deployments, retain the application's `composer.lock` and run
`composer install`. Deploy the reviewed dependency versions and configuration.

## Logging and callbacks

Set `params.strangler.log_requests` to `true`. Add a Yii log route if the application
does not already collect the category:

```php
'components' => [
    'log' => [
        'class' => 'CLogRouter',
        'routes' => [[
            'class' => 'CFileLogRoute',
            'levels' => 'info, warning, error',
            'categories' => 'strangler',
            'logFile' => 'strangler.log',
        ]],
    ],
],
```

If a request stays in Yii, check the feature's boolean value, its mapped action and
configured bypass conditions. Use your existing `X-Request-Id` to correlate systems;
Strangler forwards a valid single-line value and includes it with the feature in
its logs. It does not create a new correlation service. Configuration and path
failures are logged as warnings; payloads and tokens are not logged.

The optional `afterAttempt($method, $path)` callback runs after a transport attempt,
including failure, **before response mapping**. It does not receive the final client
response. Keep it small: a thrown callback or adapter exception reaches Yii's error
handler and can prevent delivery of a response even after a successful backend
write. Test these hooks and never replay writes to compensate for their errors.

## Local development

To work on the package beside a Yii application, clone the repository and add a
Composer path repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cosmira/yii1-strangler-proxy.git ../yii1-strangler-proxy
composer config repositories.yii1-strangler-proxy path ../yii1-strangler-proxy
composer require cosmira/yii1-strangler-proxy:dev-main
```

A path repository is for development; deploy the tagged VCS dependency and the
application's lock file. If you deploy a path checkout, pin its reviewed commit
explicitly and ensure that exact checkout is present during installation.
